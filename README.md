I am a currently a Technical Support Engineer (5+ years) and now I'm trying to pivot in Cybersecurity.

## Objective
 
With over five years of experience as a Technical Support Engineer, I have developed a strong foundation in troubleshooting, root cause analysis, investigation, and research—skills that closely align with cybersecurity principles. My passion for cybersecurity stems from the analytical mindset required to solve complex technical challenges, uncover security threats, and continuously adapt to evolving risks.
I am now eager to transition into cybersecurity, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or Cybersecurity Analyst. My goal is to leverage my problem-solving expertise and technical background to contribute to threat detection, incident response, and security operations while continuously expanding my knowledge in the field
